# PalGen 
**Alpha 1.0**

## Description
Generates a 3x3 color palette based on an image. It uses K-mean clustering to pick out the 6 most prominent colors and presents it as an image file with the palette and original image. PalGen has a barebones UI using the tkinter Python library; it prompts the user to choose an image, and input/output directories.

## Installation
Download the above files into a desired directory. Use the PalGen.bat file to run the program. **Optional**: Create a desktop shortcut to the .bat file. Feel free to include the provided icon
